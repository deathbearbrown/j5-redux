# j5-redux

This is a little boilerplate for setting up a [Johnny Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) app with [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).

### Why redux?

It lets you centralize your state management in one place.  Instead of passing a lot of code inside of j5-events, dispatch to the state and hook up listeners for changes.

Also, because why not.

### How can I use this?

Now it's time for choose your own documentation adventure.
